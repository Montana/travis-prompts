So you just made a really cool program in Python, or the language that you like, and you happen to be using the best CI/CD provider out there right now. (Travis CI). Now it comes to you, Python is asking the conditional you added, "Do you want to generate another name?" - your build is stuck and ends up timing out. Don't worry, let me help you get out of this jam, and we'll get out of it together.

## Let's get started

In some builds you'll sometimes you come across `interactive prompts`, this is usually asking if you want to upgrade packages, or if it's something you made in Python say a 'name generator', and after it executes, it will ask "Generate another name?" - This would hold the build, and stop it from building - in turn causing the build to fail. In some cases you can use `expect` to hop over this, but sometimes that doesn't always work. In my years and years of using Travis I've always had a special way of doing this, and it's really simple. I use a `.txt` file. 

## The situation

So let's say your program is called `namegen.py`, and the outcome of this after it's executed is 'Would you like another name generated? Y/N?', it's now stuck, now what?!  Well don't panic. So we know Python is looking for the inputs `Y` or `N`, so you're not going to want Python to generate anymore names, so let's make a `.txt` file and entitle it `answer.txt` (it can be called anything) and add it to our `.travis.yml`. This is how the `script` hook would look and how you tell Travis to call `answer.txt`: 

```yaml
script: python3 hello.py < answer.txt
```
Now rerun your build, and it will hopefully be successful, and don't feel bad if you've ran into this problem, we all have! 

Happy building!
